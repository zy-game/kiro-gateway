"""
Truncation recovery system for handling upstream Kiro API limitations.

Generates synthetic messages to inform the model about truncation.
ONLY activates when truncation is actually detected.

This module addresses Issue #56 - Kiro API truncates large tool call payloads
and content mid-stream. Since this is an upstream limitation that cannot be
prevented, we inform the model about the truncation so it can adapt its approach.
